            Recursion (Recursive)-
            A programming technique in which you describe actions to be repeated using a method
            that calls itself.

            Base Case -
            A case within a recursive solution that is so simple that it can be solved directly
            without a recursive call.

            Recursive Case  -
            A case within a recursive solution that involves reducing the overall problem to a
            simpler problem of the same kind that can be solved by a recursive call.
